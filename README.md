# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis using three deep learning models: Simple Neural Network (NN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and achieved accuracy of about 86.5%. A **Streamlit web app** is created to allow easy interaction with the models.

## Models Trained

- **NN**: Simple fully connected network for sentiment classification.
- **CNN**: Convolutional layers for text-based sentiment analysis.
- **LSTM**: Sequential model for better handling of text data with context.

## Web App

The **Streamlit** web app lets users input text and get sentiment predictions (positive, negative, neutral) using any of the trained models.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishwamohansinghnegi/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```
Note : Model and tokenizer will be automatically saved.

### 4. Run the Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
